OpenWeatherApp is responsible for getting the Weather Information of your device current location 
in timely Manner. It gives you the information like temprature, feels like temprature, wind speed, humidity and other realted information.


# Design of App

OpenWeatherApp has been designed with ionic+react technology stack. Jest framework has been used for writing test cases in react. 


# Future Release

Need to add the support of ProgressBar support in Notification. So Whenever api hits it will show the notification with progress bar and disapper once response is fetched successfully.

More unit test cases for robust product.
